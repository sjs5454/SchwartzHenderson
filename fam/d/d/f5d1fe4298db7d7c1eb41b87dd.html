					<p>
					From Paula's report:
					</p>
					<p>
					Harry Schwartz (Marcus's father) was the son of Joseph Schwartzman (changed to Schwartz upon entry to the US). Harry grew tobacco in today's Ukraine. Harry travelled down river ("Graenitz"? between  Besarabia and Russia) to sell tobacco to Rose Trachtenbroit's father in town of Mogilev-Podolski (in today's Ukraine). That is where he met Rose.<br />
					Rose is the daughter of her father's first wife (who was killed ina sleigh accident as a young woman). Rose eventually 'escaped' to an 'aunt' in England. She was then sent to an "uncle" (the aunt's brother) Frank, who lived on Webster Ave, in the Bronx, NY.<br />
					Harry followed her to the US.
					</p>
					<p>
					Joseph also came to the US and became a presser in the garment trade. Harry started as a sewer in the fur trade; eventually he owned a small manufacturer, but lost money and went out of business. Harry then bought a corner toy and stationary store (at NW corner of 233rd and White Plains Rd, Bronx, NY). At some time after they were married, Rose took a trip to visit 'baths' in Mont Cliners?, Michigan. Rose left son Marc at 'Bubba's' (Marc's grandmother, Bela Schwartz) house while she was away. Bubba told Harry that Rose wasn't at the baths, but that she was 'fooling around' with another man. When Rose returned home, Harry told Rose what Bubba had said. Rose was so angry that she broke off all relations with the Schwartz side of the family. From then on, Harry never saw his brother and sisters (Abe (Abraham), Anna,<br />
					Clara (Chika- pronounced 'chyka'), and Rachel.
					</p>
					<p>
					Abe, Harry's brother, lived in Brooklyn, NY. Never had children.
					</p>
					<p>
					Anna, Harry's sister, lived with her mother (Bubba Bela) after her husband died in WWII. She had 1 son.
					</p>
					<p>
					Clara (Chika), Harry's sister, lived in the Bronx, NY. Had 2 children.<br />
					Marriage Record shows name as Herry Shwartzman married to Marim R. Trachtenbrot GS Film Number 1940524 Refrence ID cn`054
